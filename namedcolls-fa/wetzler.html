<h3 id="ref2">Historical / Biographical Note</h3>
<p>Hermann Hans Wetzler was born in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1870 and died in New York City in 1943. An organist, conductor, and composer, Wetzler was the son of American parents and spent his childhood in the United States. In 1882, he returned to Frankfurt to study at the Hoch Conservatory under Clara Schumann and others. From 1897 until 1901, he was the organist at Old Trinity Church in New York, where he had settled upon his return from Germany.</p>
<p>In 1903, he organized the Wetzler Symphony Concerts, with which Richard Strauss appeared as conductor for the first time in the United States in 1904. In 1905 Wetzler returned to Germany, where he held various musical posts. After 1923 he was a guest conductor with different European orchestras. Wetzler retired to Switzerland, but eventually returned to the United States where he died in 1943.</p>
<p>Wetzler was a virtuoso in his treatment of the modern orchestra and showed a preference for symphonic program music.</p>
